Programming #1
1. Rectangle.java = implements Rectangle class. Also implements Comparable (by area) in order to test binary search method on Rectangle[]
2. CompareByArea.java = Comparator that compares 2 Rectangles by their area
3. CompareByPerimeter.java = Comparator that compares 2 Rectangles by their perimeter
4. Problem1.java = final class that implements findMax() (tested in main())
run using Problem1.java

Programming #2 
1. Problem2.java = implements binary search recursively (binarySearch() is overloaded with a helper function that does the recursive work) (tested in main())
run using Problem2.java

Programming #3
1. MakeChange.java = determines the distinct ways to make change for a given number of cents (makeChange() is overloaded with a helper function that does the recursive work) (tested in main())
run using MakeChange.java, uses a single integer command line argument for the number of cents to make change for
